# Minimizing-Lennard-Jones-Potential-Using-Genetic-Algorithms
## Description of the project
The purpose of this project is exploring arrangements of atoms in 3d-space, in order to find the optimal structure that minimizes the dynamic energy of the atoms' cluster defined by Lennard-Jones. In an effort to achive that, we utilized various Genetic Algorithms. Îœore specifically the Genetic Algorithms used are:

1. **Genetic** algorithm with **binary** representation and **roulette wheel** selection.
2. **Genetic** algorithm with **binary** representation and **tournament** selection.
3. **Genetic** algorithm with **real** representation.
4. **Particle Swarm Optimization** with **global best** model.
5. **Particle Swarm Optimization** with **local best** model.

Finally we present the expirimental results, that shows that the Genetic algorithm with real representation yieds the best results.
